# Beat The Bank

A fun little speech-to-text/text-to-speech game.  My kids love this game on the radio called "Beat the Bank".  Basically, you
keep asking the announcer to continue.  If you get lucky, the amount keeps going up per "vault".  If you're really lucky, you win the jackpot,
and if you aren't lucky at all - you hit the alarm and get nothing.
