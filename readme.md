# Beat The Bank

A fun little speech-to-text/text-to-speech game.  My kids love this game on the radio called "Beat the Bank".  Basically, you
keep asking the announcer to continue.  If you get lucky, the amount keeps going up per "vault".  If you're really lucky, you win the jackpot,
and if you aren't lucky at all - you hit the alarm and get nothing.

This game is not designed to look pretty, in fact, it looks quite disgusting as with all of my sample.  I do pretty code, not pretty UI.

The main objectives were:
* Please kids
* Show off speech to text
* Show off text to speech
* Show off structured pretty code

IMO, I have checked all the above boxes.  Now go forth with that knowledge and zero judgement of UI ;)
